# Meal-Planner
Meal-Planner is a web-application based on NodeJS which uses JS for the backend-logic and stores meals in a SQLite-database.

## Running the application locally
You can start the application in your local network with the command `node server.js`
Make sure that you're in the root directory where  *[server.js](https://github.com/fwugeditsch-tgm/meal-planner/blob/main/server.js)* is stored.
